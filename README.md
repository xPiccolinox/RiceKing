# Rice King

Platformer game inspired by other game named `"Jump King"`.  

In Rice King you take control of a little `Rice Bowl`, destined to be devoured by the almighty `Rice God`.  
Climb up and stay determined little one, for your journey won't be easy.

I made Rice King as my very first JavaScript project, it helped me to understand JS in practice.  
Files and the code itself look kinda messy but please bear in mind that it was my **first** project, I didn't know
